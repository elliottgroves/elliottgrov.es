        tips: "1. **You are the entry fragger**. This means you should always be in front of your teammates, and first in on an execute. **Do not ever lurk** (i.e. leave your team to play individually).\n" +
            "2. Communicate to your team when you are going in so they can move into the space you created for them and trade you when you die.\n" +
            "3. Dying is okay! You are still generating value for your team by creating space for them to follow up on.\n" +
            "4. Don't be afraid to throw your grenade on contact with an enemy. Even if it doesn't cause a lot of damage, slowing down their execute or pushing them off an angle is the value you want to get on Fracture especially.",
        reasons: "Raze is the best duelist at controlling a choke point with her utility. The grenade and boom bot allow you to slow down a fast execute on defense, and her blast packs let you take a lot of space on offense which are both critical elements to Fracture."
