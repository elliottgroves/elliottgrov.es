1. **You are the entry fragger**. This means you should always be in front of your teammates, and first in on an execute. **Do not ever lurk** (i.e. leave your team to play individually).
2. Communicate to your team when you are going in so they can move into the space you created for them and trade you when you die.
3. Dying is okay! You are still generating value for your team by creating space for them to follow up on.
4. Don't be afraid to throw your grenade on contact with an enemy. Even if it doesn't cause a lot of damage, slowing down their execute or pushing them off an angle is the value you want to get on Fracture especially.
